title: Beginning 100 Days of Gatsby

I'm excited to take the #100DaysOfGatsby challenge to push myself to become a better developer. This new blog is part of the first week's challenge to create a Gatsby blog from scratch and document my journey. My main goals are listed below. I hope to focus on each of these areas each week, but I will make adjustments based on my progress and my focus.

- Internationalization
  - I have a blog for church articles built on Gatsby, and I hope to internationalize it to provide articles and an interface in both English and Spanish. I could then internationalize this programming blog as well to provide more Spanish developer content.
- Animations in Gatsby
  - Sarah Drasner's article about [Native-Like Animations on web pages](https://css-tricks.com/native-like-animations-for-page-transitions-on-the-web/) and Design Better's [Animation Handbook](https://www.designbetter.co/animation-handbook/purpose) inspired me to learn more about animation to make the web a friendlier, more comfortable place. I'll be watching LevelUpTutorials' [Animating React course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/animating-react) to kick-start this process.
- A redesign of my portfolio site.
  - I've always struggled with coming up with a design, and I usually just jump straight in to the programming which leaves me with a rough product. I'll be watching LevelUpTutorials' [Mastering Figma](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/mastering-figma) course to become familiar with a design tool.
- Make component library
  - An important part of forming a cohesive experience across a website is following a design system. I want to look into creating a component library for some of the elements that I use often on my personal sites. I will also look into using CSS-in-JS, as I'm not currently comfortable with it.
- Making a gatsby plugin
  - This is more of a stretch goal. I'm very interested in how Gatsby source plugins work, and I'd like to learn more about how Gatsby works behinds the scenes.
