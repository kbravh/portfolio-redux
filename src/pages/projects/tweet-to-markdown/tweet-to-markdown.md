As I've been getting into Zettelkasten note taking with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), I wanted a way to quickly and easily save a tweet into my notes. Thus was born this command line tool. Just pass in a Tweet URL, and the tool will automatically save the tweet to a Markdown file (or copy to the clipboard). It captures images, links, hashtags, handles, polls, and almost anything else the tweet contains.
