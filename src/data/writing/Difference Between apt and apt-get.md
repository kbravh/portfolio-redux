Debian shipped with the `apt` command in 2014 to package the most common functionality of `apt-get` and `apt-cache` into one useful package while leaving the more obscure commands behind.

`apt` also provides sensible defaults, like showing the download progress bar and showing the number of packages that can be updated.
