A memory scaffold is a symbolic construct that represents the way that memories are stored and retrieved in the human mind.

We do not have perfect recall, and our memories are not stored by date or time or other easily-recallable attributes like computer databases. Instead, memories are tied to one another and form a sort of graph or map that connects various nodes.

Almost all of us have experienced an old, forgotten memory being triggered by a smell or taste. That smell or taste linked us to other connected nodes in the memory scaffold that weren't easily accessible from other nodes.

Stronger or more frequently recalled memories can act as entry points into this graph, as they are easier to recall.

Mnemonics can act as a sort of memory scaffold.
