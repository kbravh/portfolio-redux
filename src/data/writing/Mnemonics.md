Mnemonics are a type of Memory Scaffold that provide a structure onto which one can attach new information. This new information can be more easily recalled using the triggers to which it is attached, since those triggers are already better embedded in the long-term memory.

Memory palaces are an example of a locative mnemonic as they are based on tying new information into a well-known physical location.
